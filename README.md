# USATF Championships Selenium Crawler

[USATF](https://www.usatf.org) hosts the **US Track & Field Championships** annually.  My friends and I like to discuss predictions on how top athletes will place in their respective events.  A few years ago I created a Google Form for us to fill out our predictions on how each event would pan out, manually inputting athlete entries into each event.  In the spirit of efficiency and some free time on my hands, I've decided to remove a few steps by learning Selenium and letting it pull athlete entries for me automatically.

Form responses for predictions get processed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V8LlXGhOIk1sRK4owY4elCGELiGPrjUSM_v1LQjzquc/edit#gid=1732666240)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V8LlXGhOIk1sRK4owY4elCGELiGPrjUSM_v1LQjzquc/edit#gid=1732666240) to track pacing.
